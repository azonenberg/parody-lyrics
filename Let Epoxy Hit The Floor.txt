"Let Epoxy Hit The Floor"
Tune: "Let The Bodies Hit The Floor" by Drowning Pool

Background:
Concrete floors are ugly and hard to keep clean. Epoxy is a great, easily cleanable surface finish, but getting good
adhesion requires a lot of prep work and the resins and hardeners are fairly nasty chemicals you don't want to get on
your skin.

Let epoxy hit the floor
Let epoxy hit the floor
Let epoxy hit the floor
Let epoxy hit the floor

Grinding the floor
Can't take much more
(Here we go, here we go, here we go now)

One, no concrete in here
Two, no concrete in here
Three, no concrete in here
Four, no concrete in here

One, paint's got to go down
Two, paint's got to go down
Three, paint's got to go down NOW

Let epoxy hit the floor
Let epoxy hit the floor
Let epoxy hit the floor
Let epoxy hit the floor
Let epoxy hit the floor
Let epoxy hit the floor

Mop it again
This is the end
(Here we go, here we go, here we go now)

One, no concrete in here
Two, no concrete in here
Three, no concrete in here
Four, no concrete in here

One, paint's got to go down
Two, paint's got to go down
Three, paint's got to go down NOW

Let epoxy hit the floor
Let epoxy hit the floor
Let epoxy hit the floor
Let epoxy hit the floor
Let epoxy hit the floor
Let epoxy hit the floor

Sweating in a hazmat suit
You're all by yourself but the job's not done
You wanted it and now you're here
Spreading the paint, against the clock

Let epoxy hit the floor
Let epoxy hit the floor
Let epoxy hit the floor
Let epoxy hit the floor

One, no concrete in here
Two, no concrete in here
Three, no concrete in here
Four, no concrete in here

One, paint's got to go down
Two, paint's got to go down
Three, paint's got to go down NOW

Let epoxy hit the floor
Let epoxy hit the floor
Let epoxy hit the floor
Let epoxy hit the floor
Let epoxy hit the floor
Let epoxy hit the floor

Hey! Come!
Hey! Come!
Hey! Come!
Hey! Come!
