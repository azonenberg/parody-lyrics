"All About That /h/"
Tune: "All About That Bass" by Meghan Trainor

Background:
Not all PCBs need to be 28 layer HDI beasts. Sometimes plain old FR4 can be beautiful in its own way.
If you reduce the thickness /h/ of the dielectric between your transmission lines and the reference plane, in-plane
signals will couple to each other less, reducing crosstalk.

Because you know I'm all about that /h/
'Bout that /h/, no crosstalk
I'm all about that /h/
'Bout that /h/, no crosstalk
I'm all about that /h/
'Bout that /h/, no crosstalk
I'm all about that /h/
'Bout that /h/... /h/... /h/... /h/

Yeah, it's pretty clear, I ain't no eye mask
But I can pass it, pass it like I'm supposed to do
`Cause I got that trace trace that all the bits chase
And all the right chips in all the right places

I see the engineers workin' that Rogers stuff
We know that shit ain't cheap, come on now, give it up
If you got SERDES, SERDES, just raise 'em up
`Cause every track of you is perfect from the striplines to the planes

Yeah, my engineer told me "don't worry about your eye"
(Shoo wop wop, sha-ooh wop wop)
He says, "Chips like a little less voltage to equalize"
(That signal, uh, that signal signal)
You know I won't be no HDI blind via motherboard
So if that's what you're into, then go 'head and move along

Because you know I'm all about that /h/
'Bout that /h/, no crosstalk
I'm all about that /h/
'Bout that /h/, no crosstalk
I'm all about that /h/
'Bout that /h/, no crosstalk
I'm all about that /h/
'Bout that /h/... Hey!

I'm bringing prepreg back
Go 'head and tell them fancy backplanes that
No, I'm just playing, I know you think you're bad
But I'm here to tell you...
Every track of you is perfect from the striplines to the planes

Yeah, my engineer told me "don't worry about your eye"
(Shoo wop wop, sha-ooh wop wop)
He says, "Chips like a little less voltage to equalize"
(That signal, uh, that signal signal)
You know I won't be no HDI blind via motherboard
So if that's what you're into, then go 'head and move along

Because you know I'm all about that /h/
'Bout that /h/, no crosstalk
I'm all about that /h/
'Bout that /h/, no crosstalk
I'm all about that /h/
'Bout that /h/, no crosstalk
I'm all about that /h/
'Bout that /h/...

You know I'm all about that /h/
'Bout that /h/, no crosstalk
I said I'm all about that /h/
'Bout that /h/, no crosstalk
I'm all about that /h/
'Bout that /h/, no crosstalk
I'm all about that /h/
'Bout that /h/...

Because you know I'm all about that /h/
'Bout that /h/, no crosstalk
I'm all about that /h/
'Bout that /h/, no crosstalk
I'm all about that /h/
'Bout that /h/, no crosstalk
I'm all about that /h/
'Bout that /h/... Hey!
I'm all about that /h/
'Bout that /h/... Hey!
I'm all about that /h/
'Bout that /h/... Hey!

Yeah yeah... oh... You know you like this /h/... Hey...
