SERDES Time
Tune: Storytime by Nightwish

Background info:
This is the story of how buses inside computers transitioned from synchronous parallel buses to bonded high speed
serial lanes with CDR.

It was the days before
When buses were parallel
Clock skew, no speed
Then one day
Widmer at IBM
Invented 8B/10B
Took a journey into high speed serial

A disk drive working group
Imagined faster drives
Within a cable of two pairs
Unleashed from clock skew
All storage, serial
Disk drive bus catching up with high speed flash

I am the DFE inside your eye
Standing strong against your ISI
I am the driver that is out of spec
(Clock tree jitter from last decade's tech!)
Every cable, every bus on board
I am the SERDES diff pair, serial
All the data that you hold dear

I am the thumbdrive
I am the PCI
I am the disk
The bus that holds you
A way to reach the 'net
The squiggly pairs
Follow the buses
SATA you know once did

Serial all the time, layout engineer's dream!
Length match the pairs
And they will send your bits
A network interface,
a PCIe card
The core of IO
is a serial transceiver

I am the DFE inside your eye
Standing strong against your ISI
I am the driver that is out of spec
(Clock tree jitter from last decade's tech!)
Every cable, every bus on board
I am the SERDES diff pair, serial
All the data that you hold dear

I am the DFE inside your eye
Standing strong against your ISI
Searching FIR taps for the best response

I am the DFE inside your eye
Standing strong against your ISI
I am the driver that is out of spec
(Clock tree jitter from last decade's tech!)
Every cable, every bus on board
I am the SERDES diff pair, serial
All the data that you hold dear
