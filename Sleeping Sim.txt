Sleeping Sim
Tune: Sleeping Sun by Nightwish

Background info:
This is the story of a signal integrity engineer running multi-hour EM field simulations to optimize performance of a
design.

Data is moving like a tide
Once inside planar waveguide
Copper traces routed best
Through connectors laid to rest

For my waves I tune the launch
For edge shape I impedance match
Packets at the end of line
Flipping bits makes a crime

I wish for S11
Under -21
EMI around me
Edges of the PCB
Oh how I wish for my sims to run fast
Running
Running
All night

SERDES with a laser heart
From optics it will depart
I'd send along a terabyte
Never finding a bad bit

Ten to the minus twelve BER
Will be desired by the spec
A moment for the ECC
Until there's no flips to correct

I wish for S11
Under -21
EMI around me
Edges of the PCB
Oh how I wish for my sims to run fast
Running
Running
All night
