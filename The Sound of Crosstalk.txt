The Sound of Crosstalk
Tune: The Sound of Silence by Simon and Garfunkel

Background info:
The lament of a PCB design engineer plagued by crosstalk and other electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) issues.

Hello Maxwell, my old friend
I've come to talk with you again
Because a field line softly creeping
Left microstrip while I was testing
And the waveform I was sending through my board
Still remains... it is the sound of crosstalk

In restless days I probed alone
Nearby striplines, coupled tones
'Neath the halo of an H-field loop
I turned my specan to the board and hoped

When my graphs were stabbed
By the peak of a coupled tone
Standing alone
It was the sound of crosstalk

And in Part Fifteen mode I saw
Ten dB over, maybe more
Radiating without antennas
Resonating without intending

SERDES sending bits
That nothing ever sees
No one can hear
Over the sound of crosstalk

"Fools" said I, "you do not know
Crosstalk like a cancer grows
Terminate, or I will reflect you
Slow your slew that I might reach you"
But my bits like silent raindrops fell
Drowned out by all the noise of crosstalk

And engineers bowed and prayed
To pass Part Fifteen today
And the lab sent out its retort
It was still a failing report

And the lab said
"The noise of the clock
Is ringing from the chamber walls
And power falls"
And whispered in the sound of crosstalk
