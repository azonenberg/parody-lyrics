The Sound of Crosstalk
Tune: The Sound of Silence by Simon and Garfunkel (modified for the musicality and lyricality of Disturbed's cover) 

Background info:
The lament of a PCB design engineer plagued by crosstalk and other electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) issues.

Hello Maxwell, my old friend
I've come to talk with you again
Because a field line, softly creeping,
Raised its edge while I was sweeping
And the signal that I'd buried in a plane
Still remains 
Within the sound of crosstalk

Through restless nights I probed alone
Near striplines; coupled tones
'Neath the halo of a field probe
I turned my spec-an to find the noise

When my plots were razed
By the ring from the rising edge
That closed the eye 
It was the sound of crosstalk

And in the chamber test I saw
Peaks that spiked by ten or more
Signals speaking without meaning
Fields leaking without grounding

SERDES sending bits
That nothing ever sees
and no one heard 
over the sound of crosstalk

"Fools" said I, "you do not know
Crosstalk like a cancer grows
Hear my words that I might teach you
Slow your slew that I might reach you"
But my bits, like silent raindrops fell
And echoed in the hells of crosstalk

And the experts swept and prayed
But the EM fields betrayed
And the BERT flashed out its warning
Bout the link that it was dropping

And the BERT said
"The codes of the prophets are twisted by jitter's thrall"
And margin falls
Words buried in the sound of crosstalk
