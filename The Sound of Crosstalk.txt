Hello Maxwell, my old friend
I've come to talk with you again 
Because a current, softly creeping
Strayed its path while I was sweeping
And the problem that I'd buried in a plane
Still remains 
Within the sound of crosstalk

Through restless nights I probed alone 
Near striplines; -- coupled tones
'Neath the halo of a field probe
I searched my traces for the source unknown

When my plots were struck
By the ring of harmonics odd 
That closed the eye
It was the sound of crosstalk

And in the chamber test I saw
Peaks that spiked by ten or more
Symbols shifting without meaning
Signals dropping without warning
SERDES sending bits
That errors never spare
And no one dared
Defy the sound of crosstalk

"Fools," said I, "you do not know
Fields spread like a cancer grows
Hear my words that I might teach you
Slow your slew that I might reach you"
But my symbols, like silent raindrops fell
And echoed in the hells of crosstalk

Countless experts swept and prayed
But the EM fields betrayed
And the BERT flashed out its warning
'Bout the link that it was dropping

And the BERT said
"The codes of the prophets are twisted by jitter's thrall"
Link margin falls
Words buried in the sound of crosstalk
