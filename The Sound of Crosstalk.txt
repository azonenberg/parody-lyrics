The Sound of Crosstalk
Tune: The Sound of Silence by Simon and Garfunkel (modified for the musicality and lyricality of Disturbed's cover) 

Background info:
The lament of a PCB design engineer plagued by crosstalk and other electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) issues.

Hello Maxwell, my old friend
I've come to talk with you again
Because a field line, softly creeping,
Raised its edge while I was sweeping
And the signal that was buried in my board
Still remains 
Within the sound of crosstalk

Through restless nights I probed alone
Near striplines; coupled tones
'Neath the halo of a field probe
I turned my scope to catch the noise

When my eyes were stabbed
By the edge of a rising tone
There not alone
It was the sound of crosstalk

And in the chamber test I saw
Peaks that spiked by ten or more
Signals speaking without meaning
Fields leaking without warning

SERDES sending bits
That nothing ever sees
and no one heard 
over the sound of crosstalk

"Fools" said I, "you do not know
Crosstalk like a cancer grows
Hear my words that I might teach you
Slow your slew that I might reach you"
But my bits, like silent raindrops fell
And echoed in the hells of crosstalk

And the experts swept and prayed
To the neon god they made
And the BERT flashed out its warning
On the link that it was dropping

Then the BERT said
"The edge of the signal is bouncing off the via stubs
Then margin falls
All smothered in the sound of crosstalk
