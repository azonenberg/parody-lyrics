# The Sound Of Crosstalk v2.1.0
Music video script v0.1

Generally intended to be a shot-for-shot recreation of the Disturbed video; overall styling and scene
compositions should reflect this.

Entire video is shot in B&W or possibly very desaturated color.

FADE IN

## INT. RF CHAMBER - NIGHT (1)

Slow pan, 12 seconds in length around a dimly lit anechoic chamber with a guitar and a spectrum analyzer on stands in
the center. The instruments are illuminated by a spotlight behind the camera.

No people in sight. Total silence, no music.

FADE TO BLACK

## INT. LABORATORY BENCH - LATER (2)

(Intro of song begins)

Screen capture of the spectrum analyzer display zoomed in on a narrowband signal using a color-ramp display,
fluctuating slowly in intensity and frequency in a manner reminisicent of a candle flame.

FADE TO BLACK just before vocals of song begin.

## INT. ENGINEERING OFFICE - LATER (3)

Desk in a darkened office, dimly lit by a computer display showing a PCB layout. Silhouetted against the display a male
head and shoulders can be seen, but too dark to make out many facial features. Focal plane is on the person with a
narrow depth of field so the computer is slightly blurred, but no so much that it's impossible to recognize the
presence of CAD software on the display.

SINGER: Hello Maxwell, my old friend
I've come to talk with you again

CUT TO next scene

## INT. LABORATORY BENCH - LATER (4)

Same spectrum analyzer display as scene 2, but zoomed out to cover a slightly wider frequency range

SINGER: Because a current, softly creeping

## INT. ENGINEERING OFFICE - LATER (5)

Screen capture of EM solver software displaying an animated current density view of a reference plane, showing current
direction arrows moving generally from top to bottom of the frame

SINGER: Strayed its path while...

FADE TO next scene

## INT. RF CHAMBER - LATER (6)

Same RF chamber as scene 1, but this time with a broadband antenna on a tripod pointed at a bench with a DUT
on it.

A male figure is standing in front of the equipment, not blocking the view of either. A dim spotlight illuminates the
center of his face.

SINGER: ... I was sweeping
And the...

CUT TO next scene

## INT. LABORATORY BENCH - LATER (7)

Closeup of the figure's face, slightly more illuminated. In the background, a slightly blurry screen capture of an
oscilloscope screen is visible. The waveform displayed is a closeup of high and low spikes, characteristic of digital
edges being AC coupled through parasitics from an adjacent trace. The spike waveforms are bracketing his face so that
the rising edge is to the left and the falling to the right.

SINGER: ... problem ...

CUT TO next scene

## INT. LABORATORY BENCH - LATER (8)

Same EM solver view as scene 5, this time showing the signal layer below the plane with two closely spaced tracks. One
has a strong current flowing in it, the second adjacent one has an induced current flowing the same direction

SINGER: ... that I'd buried in a plane

CUT TO next scene

## INT. LABORATORY BENCH - LATER(9)

Closeup of a power supply, presumably powering the DUT. A finger slowly reaches out towards the "channel on/off"
button, as if shutting down the DUT in frustration when yet another round of tests fails.

SINGER: Still remains

FADE TO black just before the finger reaches the button.

## INT. LABORATORY BENCH - LATER (10)

Same framing and crosstalk waveform as scene 7

SINGER: Within the sound of crosstalk

FADE TO black during the last few words

## INT. LABORATORY BENCH - NIGHT (11)

Long shot of an engineer from behind, sitting at a bench in a darkened laboratory lit only by the screens of various
pieces of test equipment. He is holding an oscilloscope probe on a test point on the DUT.

SINGER: Through restless nights I probed alone

CUT TO next scene

## INT. LABORATORY BENCH - LATER (12)

Closeup of a 20mm nearfield loop antenna, slowly moving left to right over a board, overlaid with a ghostly transparent
screen capture of a spectrum analyzer showing interference peaks coming and going as the antenna moves

SINGER: Near striplines, coupled tones

CUT TO next scene

## INT. LABORATORY BENCH - LATER (13)

Upward view from the DUT's perspective, filmed through the loop of the probe and looking up at the engineer. Focal
plane on the engineer's face, antenna slightly blurred. The engineer has a confused, frustrated look on his face.

SINGER: 'Neath the halo of a field probe

CUT TO next scene

## INT. LABORATORY BENCH - LATER (14)

Same framing as scene 12

SINGER: I searched my traces for the source unknown

## INT. RF CHAMBER - LATER (15)

Same framing as scene 6

SINGER: When my plots were struck

CUT TO next scene

## INT. LABORATORY BENCH - LATER (16)

Screen capture of an oscilloscope showing an almost completely closed eye pattern

SINGER: By the ring of harmonics odd
That closed the eye
It was the sound...

## INT. RF CHAMBER - LATER (16)

Same framing as scene 6

CUT TO next scene

SINGER: ... of crosstalk

FADE TO black

## INT. RF CHAMBER - LATER (17)

Long shot of an engineer standing in the chamber

SINGER: And in the chamber test...

JUMP CUT to closer view looking up at engineer's face, with a look of despair on it

SINGER: ... I saw

CUT TO next scene

## INT. LABORATORY BENCH - LATER (18)

Screen capture of a spectrum analyzer running Part 15 compliance test software, showing a radiated tone 10 dB above the
failure line

SINGER: Peaks that spiked by ten or more

CUT TO next scene

## INT. LABORATORY BENCH - LATER (19)

Screen capture of an oscilloscope running an 8B/10B decoder on a very noisy signal showing many invalid symbols.
Overlaid on the screen capture are two copies of the singer's face back to back.

SINGER: Symbols shifting without meaning

CUT TO next scene

## INT. LABORATORY BENCH - LATER (19)

Closeup of BERT front panel showing link lights turning off

SINGER: Signals dropping without warning

## INT. ENGINEERING OFFICE - LATER (20)

Text editor showing RTL for 10Gbase-R PCS, slowly scrolling

SINGER: SERDES sending bits...

Linux console showing pings with no reply coming back fades into view on the right half of the screen, above the RTL

SINGER: That errors never spare

CUT TO next scene

## INT. RF CHAMBER - LATER (21)

Closeup of engineer's face with defocused RF chamber in background

SINGER: And no one dared

FADE TO black

## EXT. RF CHAMBER - LATER (22)

Side view of engineer on hands and knees facing left, silhouetted against the inside of the RF chamber. He is looking
at a piece of paper on the floor in front of him. The camera slowly zooms in on the paper.

SINGER: Defy the sound

CUT TO closeup of the page and the engineer's hand holding it. The page is an EMC test report with a failing result.

SINGER: of crosstalk

CUT TO next scene

## INT. RF CHAMBER - LATER (23)

Same framing as scene 21

SINGER: "Fools," said I, "you do not know
Fields spread like a cancer grows

CUT TO next scene

## EXT. RF CHAMBER - LATER (24)

Bottom 3/4 view of engineer outside RF chamber, holding the failing report and slowly standing up. His head is off
camera.

SINGER: Hear my words that I might teach you

CUT TO next scene

## INT. ENGINEERING OFFICE - LATER (25)

Rapid montage of test equipment displays showing interference suddenly disappearing, ending with an oscilloscope screen
showing a sharp, ringing edge suddenly having its drive strength reduceds and turning into a slow smooth waveform with
a much longer rise time

SINGER: Slow your slew that I might reach you

CUT TO next scene

## INT. LABORATORY BENCH - LATER (26)

Screen capture of BERT display showing a high number of errors, rapidly increasing, with the singer's face floating in
front of it

SINGER: But my symbols, like silent raindrops fell

FASE TO black

## INT. RF CHAMBER - LATER (27)

Engineer standing in the empty RF chamber

SINGER: And echoed in the hells of crosstalk

CUT TO next scene

## INT. LABORATORY BENCH - LATER (28)

Rapid montage of different engineers poking at the board. The more cameos we can get here the better.

SINGER: Countless experts swept and prayed

Same setup as scene 7

SINGER: But the EM fields betrayed
