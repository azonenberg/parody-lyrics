Still Online
Tune: Still Alive by Jonathan Coulton and GLaDOS

Background info:
This is the story of a CS major at RPI and the trials and tribulations of debugging his code.
Russell Sage College is an all-female school across town without much in the way of science or engineering programs.

This was a segfault! I'm making a note here... SIGSEGV.
	It's hard to overstate my stack corruption!

RPI comp sci... we do what we must, because we can
	for the good of all of us (except the ones who flunked out)
But there's no sense crying over every bad grade
	you just keep on trying till you get your degree
And the coding gets done and you make a release
	for the servers that are still online

I'm not even angry. I'm being so sincere right now.
	Even though you DOSed my servers...
Disabled my uplink...
	And piped all my traffic to /dev/null
As i watched, it hurt because
	I was completely offline!

Now these silicon atoms make a beautiful grid
	and we're out of beta, we're releasing on time
 So i'm glad i went here, think of all the things we learned
	for the people still at RPI.

Go ahead and leave me, I think I prefer to code alone.
	Maybe you'll find someone else to dev with...
Maybe Sage College... That was a joke. HAHA FAT CHANCE.

Anyway this app is great. it's so responsive and quick!
(Look at me still talking when there's coding to do)
When i look up there it makes me glad i'm not you...
	I've got MD sims to run, there is research to be done
For the people who are still online

And believe me I am still online
	I feel fantastic and I am still online
While you're coding I'll be still online...
	and when you're asleep I'll be still online...

Still online...

Still online
